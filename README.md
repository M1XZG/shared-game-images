## 🖼️ Automated Poster Replacement Script

This repository includes an automation tool for managing VRChat world poster images:

- **[replace_posters.py](scripts/replace_posters.py)**: A Python script that automatically replaces poster images for each world with new images from a pool, ensuring no duplicates within a world and avoiding reusing the same image for a poster (when possible).
	- See the detailed [script documentation](scripts/README.md) for flow, logic, and usage instructions.
